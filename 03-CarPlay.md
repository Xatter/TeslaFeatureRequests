# Apple Carplay

I don't really care if it's wired or wireless, but the navigation experience in the car is barely adequite. At least on the East Coast. Super late notifications of turns, at least once every trip it tries to make me do something illegal like turn onto a one way street going the wrong way or gives me the name of a street that doesn't exist, etc.

I'd really appreciate if I could use Carplay just like in the Lucid.

kthxbye
