# Apple Carplay

I don't really care if it's wired or wireless, but the navigation experience in the car is barely adequite. At least on the East Coast. 

Some of the issues include: 
* Super late notifications of turns
* At least once every trip it tries to make me do something illegal like turn onto a one way street going the wrong way 
* Gives me the name of a street that doesn't exist, etc.
* Tells me to change lanes only to immediately, or a minute later, tell me to change back. Frustrating in crowded NYC, especially if I'm new to an area and don't yet know myself which lane I need to be in.

I'd really appreciate if I could use Carplay just like in the Lucid.

kthxbye
