# Official Tesla Supercharger Queuing System

When it is detected that super chargers are full, *like it does now in order to tell you there’s a wait.* **Activate Queue mode!**

In queue mode, when you approach the super charger station (0.5 mi away?) you are prompted in the car that this super charger currently has a queue, and given a button to join the queue.

When it is your turn you get a notification in the car and on the app telling you which charger number to use. You have 5 min to start charging or you lose your slot. **If someone else tries to charge there when it is your turn, they can’t charge.** Maybe they receive a notification telling them it isn't their turn.

If you drive away you are automatically dequeued. You can manually dequeue.

Once the queue is complete and there are free chargers, deactivate queue mode. Super chargers operate normally when not fully booked (you drive up and plug in)

Now that Tesla is planning to let others onto the super charger network, those people will have to use the App to do the queuing just like they do in order to pay.
